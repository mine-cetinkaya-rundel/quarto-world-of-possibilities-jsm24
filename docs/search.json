    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. This feature-rich system is suitable for reproducible data analysis at all levels, from a simple homework assignment in an introductory statistics course to a computing-intensive, multi-language project. This session aims to introduce Quarto to those who are new to it as well as help those who have worked with it before diving deeper to help them find features of the toolkit that might help them in various aspects of their work. The session features five speakers who have been developing, using, and teaching Quarto over the last three years. The speakers will share their experiences with a wide range of features of Quarto, from creating single documents to complex book projects. The talks will also touch on multiple programming languages (R and Python) and tools (RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks). Topics discussed will include tips for creating highly stylized, reproducible slide decks, authoring technical books and documentation, and publication-ready scientific manuscripts with embedded computing. The session will also feature a walkthrough of making a personal/academic/research group website with a blog. The talks will feature code examples in R and Python, and one talk specifically will focus on using Quarto with Jupyter Notebooks and Python.\nSession chair: Maria Tackett - Duke\nSession organizer: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel - Duke University + Posit"

    "text": "As a data professional, at some point, you’ll want a website, whether it’s for yourself, a project, or a research group. Quarto is a great way to make one: build your site with plain text files that you can edit in your favorite tool and check in to version control; structure your content into folders and pages in a way that makes sense to you; create content that includes code and its output; and generate listing pages that help readers navigate collections of content like projects, publications or people.\nIn this talk, I’ll walk you through the process from scratch. You’ll see how to get started with a basic template and then edit it to your needs, including adding pages, customizing navigation, adding a blog or other listing, personalizing the appearance, and getting it online."

As the name implies the parsermd package was originally developed for the parsing and manipulation of RMarkdown documents, but we have recently worked to expand this functionality to support Quarto documents and their specific features (e.g. fenced divs, yaml chunk options, shortcodes, etc.). We will briefly review the structure of a typical Quarto document and how this is then represented within R once parsed as an abstract syntax tree (AST). The remainder of the talk will then focus on practical usage examples of these tools for teaching with Quarto, including automated feedback and cleaning, document restructuring, and others time permitting."
